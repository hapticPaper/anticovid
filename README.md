# Covid Infection and Potential Antibody Community Assessment 

Covid-19 has mutated into several strains, and there has been a very wide range of infection serverity. Through analyzing the symptoms of individuals known to have been infected - either though an infection or anti-body test - the symptoms of untested individuals can be used to predict the likelihood of their infection. This combined with an estimate of potentially asymptomatic indivudals though antibody testing will help predict the overall infection rates for a community.
